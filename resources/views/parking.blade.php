<h2>Game Day Parking</h2>



<p>The Touchdown Club of Oklahoma offers free game day parking for members in the Parkview and South Jenkins lots.  We also have a few select spaces in the Asp Ave. Garage that are available on a lottery basis*.

   Parking information will be mailed to you.  You must fill out a form to receive parking.  You can fill the form out here or email your preference to <a href="mailto:outdclub@outdclub.com">outdclub@outdclub.com</a>.

   If requesting Asp Ave. Garage Parking Facility, please include your credit card information and mark a second choice in case you aren't drawn.
