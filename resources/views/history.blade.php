<p>We are an independent, not for profit organization governed by a board of directors that works closely with the OU Athletic Department.  Our only purpose is to promote and support OU Football.  All of the funds we donate to the University go to support the football program.</p>

<p>In over sixty years of its existence, the Touchdown Club has spanned the glory years of Sooner Football, providing over $6 million in financial support to the OU Athletic Department.  We are one of the top donors to the Athletic Department.</p>

<p>In addition to scholarships, the Touchdown Club has provided financial support of non-scholarship related projects:  every playing surface on Owen Field since the early 1970's, as well as upgrades to the Ida Mosier Indoor Practice Facility, refurbished athletic dorms and weight rooms.</p>
<h1>TODAY</h1>
<p>The Touchdown Club contributed $750,000 to help in the construction of the Barry Switzer Center.  In appreciation, the University of Oklahoma has named a portion of the Center The Touchdown Club of Oklahoma Legends Lobby.  This impressive facility highlights the rich tradition of Sooner Football that has been helped along by the donations of generations of Touchdown Club members.</p>

<p>In 2004, The Touchdown Club donated $150,000 for the new grass playing surface on Owen Field.  That same year, The Touchdown Club partnered with the OU Athletic Department and the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame, Oklahoma Chapter to support amateur football by providing eleven scholarships for Oklahoma high school students and to promote Oklahoma's deserving collegiate athletes and coaches for election into the College Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>In 2007, The Touchdown Club funded a football endowment scholarship in the name of Joe Washington, known as the "Touchdown Club Football Scholarship." </p>

<p>In order to continue to help provide first-class facilities and scholarship aid to Sooner student athletes, The Touchdown Club needs the participation and support of ardent and generous OU fans.  FANS LIKE YOU!</p>
